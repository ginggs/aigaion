    
    This documentation is for migrating an existing Aigaion 1.x installation to Aigaion 2.0
    If you want to install Aigaion 2.0 from scratch, with an empty database, follow the instructions 
    in _INSTALL.txt
    
    The instructions below presume the following:
    - The existing Aigaion 1.x is installed in the directory <WEBROOT>/<aigaion1_rootdir>/
    - The attachments in the existing Aigaion 1.x are stored in the directory 
        <WEBROOT>/<aigaion1_rootdir>/<documents_dir>/
    - The Aigaion 1.x MYSQL database is named '<db_aigaion1>'
    - You want to install Aigaion 2.0 in the directory <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/
    - The attachments in the new Aigaion 2.0 will be stored in a directory 
        <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/<documents_dir>/
    - The Aigaion 2.0 MYSQL database will be named '<db_aigaion2>'
    
    NOTE: We do our best to provide you with safe and sound installation instructions. However,
    in the world of computers and software installations many things can go wrong. Remember 
    therefore that you should install Aigaion 2.0 in a new location using a new database, and you 
    should not delete your old installation and database of Aigaion 1.x until Aigaion 2.0 has run 
    long enough that you can be certain that no data was accidentally destroyed. And *please*, 
    remember to keep making database backups regularly.
    
    NOTE 2: We have a simplistic mechanism to provide a little bit of security for the install scripts. 
    However, that security is only designed to work for a short time while you are actually installing - 
    afterwards you should simply remove the two directories containing the install and migration scripts.

    NOTE 3: Aigaion 2.0 uses UTF8 throughout the site. If you are running a very old mysql version (< 4.1),
    this gives some problems with the migration script. In that case, read the file '_OLD_MYSQL.txt', and 
    replace step 8 below with a visit to an alternative migration page.
    
    INSTALLING AIGAION 2 ON THE SAME SERVER WHERE AIGAION 1 IS RUNNING
    0)  backup your Aigaion 1.x installation using the backup function on the maintenance page. Store the backup 
        somewhere for safety.
    1)  Copy the Aigaion 2.0 files to <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/
    2)  Copy the attachments from your previous installation <WEBROOT>/<aigaion1_rootdir>/<documents_dir>/
        to your new installation <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/<documents_dir>/
    3)  Create the new database '<db_aigaion2>', with an appropriate user. The database is empty.
    4)  Unpack <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migrate/migrate.zip into the directory <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migrate/
    5)  Make sure that the migration files and the Aigaion files are readbale for the web user...
    6)  fill in the appropriate MYSQL info in the file <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migration/migrate_config.php
        (both for the old installation, and for the new installation)
    7)  define password for installing in <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migration/migrate_config.php
    8)  go to http://<server>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migration/migrate.php
      OR, IF YOUR SERVER RUNS A MYSQL VERSION < 4.1
           go to http://<server>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migration/migrate_oldmysql.php
    9)  ensure through some spot checks that special characters in your database (non ascii, accented, diacritics, 
        chinese, arabic, etc) are not broken in the new Aigaion 2.0 database. If they are, please contact the 
        *developers* to help fix this problem.
    10) if no errors occurred, the database has been initialized correctly. You can now proceed to 
        configure your Aigaion 2 installation in the following steps.
    11) Rename <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/sample_index.php to <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/index.php
    12) Fill in the user configurable settings in index.php (note the 'END OF USER CONFIGURABLE SETTINGS' comment)
    13) Login to Aigaion 2 from http://<server>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/ using username:admin and password:admin
    14) Change the admin login
    15) RUN A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE CHECKS on the site maintenance page. Especially, don't forget to 
        run 'Check searchable names and titles'
    
    last) if migration was successfull, remove the directory <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/install
    last) if migration was successfull, remove the directory <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/migration
    last) if migration was successfull, deactivate old Aigaion 1.x installation by renaming index.php.
