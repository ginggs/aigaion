Aigaion 2.0 has been developed on MySQL versions 4.1 or higher.
However, the one difference with older versions of MySQL is the fact that below 4.1, MySQL does not officially support UTF8 character sets.

This is not much of a problem 

When running on MySQL 3.23 for example, any UTF8 data would be input into the mysql database as UTF8 data, MySQL does not understand it, and stores it as gibberish. When returning the same data from the database, MySQL passes it along as gibberish, but since Aigaion knows that it is UTF8, it can still handle the data correctly. 

However, we had to provide *separate installation and migration scripts for older MySQL versions*, by removing the character set commands. So, when you install on a machine with an old MySQL version, please take care that you run the correct script, mentioned in the install or update instructions.

This is all no problem, but when you ever upgrade your mysql you'd need to run a smart conversion because the old version of MySQL did not understand about the data being in UTF8 and the new version of MySQL can therefore not encode the data properly. This is not a difficult problem to solve, so we will provide in the future some explanation here as to how to do this. If this explanation is not here yet, go to the Aigaion forums and ask about conversion there.
